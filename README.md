Dynamic Portfolio Generator
A React.js application that lets users build, view, and manage their own professional portfolios. Select a template, fill out a form, and your new portfolio page is generated instantly.
(Important: Add a screenshot or a GIF of your running application here! This is the best way to show recruiters what you built.)
